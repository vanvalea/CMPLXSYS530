<p>NetLogo supports <a href="extensions.html">extensions</a> as a way of adding functionality that it does not already provide.  Here are a few common reasons you might want to make an extension:</p>
<ul>
<li>There can be hardware you want NetLogo to talk to that it doesn&rsquo;t already support.  Examples of this include <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Sound-Extension" target="_blank">the Sound extension</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Arduino-Extension" target="_blank">the Arduino extension</a>.</li>
<li>There can other programming languages that provide functionality you want to use from inside NetLogo code, such as R&rsquo;s statistical calculations or Python&rsquo;s machine learning libraries.  Examples here are <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/R-Extension" target="_blank">the R extension</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Python-Extension" target="_blank">the Python extension</a>.</li>
<li>There can be data structures or algorithms that are hard to support with NetLogo, like matrix manipulation or key/value stores for program data.  <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Matrix-Extension" target="_blank">The Matrix extension</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Table-Extension" target="_blank">the Table extension</a> are examples that solve these problems.</li>
<li>You may want to expose NetLogo internal data that&rsquo;s not otherwise available, or in a different way than the built-in primitives do.  Examples here are <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Profiler-Extension" target="_blank">the Profiler extension</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Reflection-Extension" target="_blank">the Reflection extension</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/ExportThe-Extension" target="_blank">the ExportThe extension</a>.</li>
<li>You may want to make functionality that works identically between NetLogo desktop and NetLogo Web.  For example, the <code>file-*</code> prims built in to NetLogo work great for desktop, but they cannot be reproduced in NetLogo Web due to the differences in how web browsers interact with files.  So <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/Fetch-Extension" target="_blank">the Fetch extension</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/SendTo-Extension" target="_blank">the SendTo extension</a> were created to operate identically in both environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>NetLogo desktop extensions can be easily written in any programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  This includes Java, Scala, and Kotlin, among others.</p>
<p>Here is a very brief outline of the process to get your project setup and producing an extension you can run with NetLogo (see below for technical details):</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a dependency on the NetLogo jar file and make sure its on available to your build tool and your IDE (such as IntelliJ) if you&rsquo;re using one.</li>
<li>Create an extension manifest file to include in your extension&rsquo;s jar file.</li>
<li>Make sure your extension&rsquo;s packaged jar file name matches the in-code name you&rsquo;ll be using (so <code>table</code> will have a <code>table.jar</code>).</li>
<li>Make sure any dependencies for your extension (libraries besides NetLogo) are included alongside your jar also.</li>
<li>Create a <code>ClassManager</code> for your extension, and create <code>Primitive</code> classes for each extension primitive you&rsquo;re making.</li>
</ul>
<p>NetLogo and many of its bundled extensions are written in Scala and so use the Scala build tool (SBT).  We&rsquo;ve created <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo-Extension-Plugin" target="_blank">a NetLogo extension plugin for SBT</a> that handles many of the above steps automatically, once it&rsquo;s configured through the <code>build.sbt</code> file.</p>

<p>To share an extension you&rsquo;ve made with the built-in <a href="extension-manager.html">Extension Manager</a>, you&rsquo;ll need to have it added to our NetLogo-Libraries repository.  See <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo-Libraries#netlogo-libraries" target="_blank">the instructions on the repository website</a> for more information.</p>
